# NewSuperJumpKing
 A mix of JumpKing and New Super Mario Bros

## Date: 4/28/2024
### Features Added:
Since this is the first github update here is everything I have done since I started
- Created my character
- Finished all my character's jumping phyisys so it is now similar to Jump King, Jumping wise.
- Added character animations
- Added collisons meaning I stand on the floor, hit my head on the ceiling, and hit the wall
### Still need to add:
- Need to create a proper first level next week
- Need to create proper collision physics, like how in jump king when the character hits the wall he bounces back
- need to create a title screen
### Issues Encountered:
- Learning GDScipt is kind of hard since I don't know the syntax that well
- Jumping Physics was tuff because when I made one feature a different feature decieded to not work anymore, For example the character is not able to move left and right white the character is in the jump animation charging. Adding that feature caused my character not to want to jump left and right, only jump up. I fixed this by adding a horizontal speed variable.
### Lesson Learned:
- Save old repositories: I think I almost lost everything like 3 times while making the begining portion of the game. If I had saved the old repositories sooner I would have had an easier time going back.
- Commenting code: In the begining I was not writing what each line did or how they were being used and when I would go back to work on the code the next day it would be a sturggle trying to remember everything.
